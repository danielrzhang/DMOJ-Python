# DMOJ-Python
This repository contains solutions to my Python 3 solutions/attempts for questions on DMOJ. 

This is currently a repository under progress as I am still migrating files over.

Do ***NOT*** copy and paste my code! Only use it if you need a nudge in the right direction for solving problems that you are stuck on.
